# Architecture Decision Records

Wursor records significant technical and product decisions as ADRs. This directory is the source of truth; PRD §14 holds the product-level "locked decisions", while these records capture the engineering choices and tradeoffs behind them.

Each ADR is a single file following the [Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions): **Status**, **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**. "Options considered" and "Rejected" are kept explicit to honor the `wursor-decision-log` skill.

## Status legend

- **Accepted** — agreed; in force.
- **Proposed** — under discussion, not yet binding.
- **Superseded** — replaced by a later ADR; see the link.
